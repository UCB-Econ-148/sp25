I am a 3rd year majoring in Economics and Data Science, and I am from Napa Valley. I am interested in behavioral economics and its intersection in health economics. I am a genius in data science as much a wine connoisseur, which is to say I am neither. But I'd love to help out with clearing up doubts about Economics and get to know everyone!
