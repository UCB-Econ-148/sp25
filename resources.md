# Resources ðŸ’»

## Textbook

We've got a [textbook](https://www.econ148.org/textbook/content/intro.html) for this course! It's written by our former GSI Rohan Jha, and is a  resource to build a solid foundation of data science for economists. We'll make sure to link relevant readings as the course progresses, but feel free to read ahead. 

## Documentation

In this course, you'll become familiar with reading lots of documentation. If you're not sure how a function works, you should type the name of the function in a cell by itself followed by `?` and run the cell (so for example, `numpy.sum?`). This will show you that function's documentation.

Official resources for you to refer to:
- [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)

## Supplementary Readings

Each of the listed online textbooks/readings will contain some material that is not in scope for our class. They all cover the fundamentals of Python, but in slightly different ways. As a reminder, you're not required to look at any of these; only look if you think they'll help you.

- [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/intro.html), the textbook for Data 100 at UC Berkeley. It is an introductory textbook for data science that will be published with Oâ€™Reilly Media in 2023. It covers foundational skills in programming and statistics that encompass the data science lifecycle.
 - [Data 100 Course Notes](https://ds100.org/course-notes/), the course notes for Data 100, a huge resource for most things that we will cover in this class.
- [Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://inferentialthinking.com), the textbook for Data 8 at UC Berkeley.
- [Stanford's Python Reference](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/py), a Python guide written for Stanford's intro CS class, is a great reference if you need a refresher on how something works.
- [Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/chapters/chapter1-basics.html) and [Dive Into Data Science](https://eldridgejm.github.io/dive_into_data_science/front.html) are also good references that are written for different classes (at UBC and UCSD, respectively) that cover the material relevant in our class and more.
- [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com), the textbook for CS 61A and CS 88 at UC Berkeley, covers Python from a more traditional computer science perspective rather than the data science perspective we will take; as such, only a few sub-chapters are relevant to us but you may find it useful nonetheless. 
- [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) is also a great reference.
